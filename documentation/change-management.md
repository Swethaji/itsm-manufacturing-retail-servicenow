## Change Management

Change Management is used when an incident requires a permanent or controlled
fix, such as system updates, configuration changes, or process improvements.

In this project, IT employees raise Change Requests when a resolution involves
modifying an existing system or service. Each change follows an approval process
to ensure accountability and risk control.

A Flow Designer workflow manages the lifecycle of a Change Request by:
- Triggering approval requests to the appropriate manager
- Updating the change state based on approval outcome
- Notifying stakeholders about the decision

This implementation demonstrates controlled change handling, which is critical
in environments where system stability and business continuity are important.
