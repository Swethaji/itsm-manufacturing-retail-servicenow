## User, Group, and Role Mapping

Users in the system are organized using assignment groups that represent
different IT teams within the organization, such as retail support,
manufacturing operations, and corporate IT.

Custom roles are associated with these groups and inherited by users through
group membership. This ensures that responsibilities are aligned with team
functions rather than assigned individually.

The design separates responsibilities between:
- IT employees handling operational tasks
- IT managers responsible for approvals and oversight

This group-based role assignment follows ServiceNow best practices and
simplifies user management while maintaining clear accountability.
