## Incident Management

Incident Management handles day-to-day IT issues reported by users across
manufacturing units, retail stores, warehouses, and corporate offices.

When an incident is created, the user selects a category that best describes
the issue. A business rule evaluates the selected category and automatically
assigns the incident to the appropriate IT support team.

Category → Assignment Group mapping:
- Production Equipment Issues → Manufacturing Operations IT
- POS / Billing Issues → Retail Technology Support
- Inventory System Issues → Warehouse & Logistics IT
- QA Device Faults → Product Quality Systems Team
- Employee IT Support → Corporate IT Service Desk

This approach eliminates manual triage and ensures faster response times by
routing incidents directly to the responsible group.

Key characteristics of the implementation:
- Category-driven incident classification
- Automatic assignment to relevant IT teams
- Clear ownership of incidents from creation to closure

This setup reflects how real organizations streamline incident handling
to reduce delays and operational overhead.
