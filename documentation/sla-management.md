## SLA Management

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define time-based commitments for resolving
critical incidents.

In this project, SLAs are applied to high-priority incidents to ensure that
business-impacting issues are addressed within an acceptable timeframe.
Once an SLA is attached, the system tracks the resolution time automatically.

If the resolution exceeds the defined limit, the incident is marked as breached,
highlighting areas where service performance can be improved.

The SLA implementation helps demonstrate:
- Priority-based service commitments
- Automated time tracking
- Visibility into response and resolution efficiency

This reflects how organizations measure and improve IT service performance.
