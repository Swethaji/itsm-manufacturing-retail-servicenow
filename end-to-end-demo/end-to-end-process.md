## End-to-End ITSM Process Flow

This document illustrates the complete lifecycle of an IT issue from creation
to resolution, involving multiple user roles.

The process begins when an end user raises an incident describing a problem.
The system automatically assigns the incident to the appropriate IT team
based on the selected category.

An IT employee investigates the issue and, if a permanent fix is required,
raises a Change Request. The Change Request is reviewed and approved by an IT
manager before implementation.

After the change is approved and applied, the IT employee resolves and closes
the incident. Dashboards and reports are updated automatically to reflect the
latest status.

This end-to-end flow demonstrates how ServiceNow supports collaboration,
governance, and visibility across IT operations.
